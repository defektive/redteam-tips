When placing Excel Macro backdoors into Excel startup, you don't have to name it Personal.xlsb, you can also call it "Draft" with no extension. It'll still start up upon opening of Excel.... Bonus point for sticking it into Roaming profile. Insert any Macro doc into:c:users%username%appdataroamingmicrosoftexcelxlstart There won't be any Macro prompts either because it's a trusted location by default.
